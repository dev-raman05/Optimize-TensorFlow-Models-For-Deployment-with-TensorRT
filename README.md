# Optimize TensorFlow Models For Deployment with TensorRT

In this project we work on optimizing the TensorFlow models for inference with NVIDIA's TensorRT. In this, we optimize Tensorflow models using the TensorFlow integration of NVIDIA's TensorRT (TF-TRT), use TF-TRT to optimize several deep learning models at FP32, FP16, and INT8 precision, and observe how tuning TF-TRT parameters affects performance and inference throughput.
